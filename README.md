# Project Background
**Company Overview**

The company is a mid-sized commercial bank operating in the retail and small-business lending space. The bank provides financial products such as personal loans, home loans, auto loans, and small business loans. Its primary business model is interest-based lending, where revenue is generated from loan interest, processing fees, and penalty charges on overdue payments.

As a Data Analyst working within the Risk & Analytics team, my role is to analyze historical loan data to support better lending decisions, monitor portfolio performance, and identify potential risk areas. The bank operates in a highly regulated environment, making accurate reporting and risk assessment critical.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings
From a portfolio and risk management perspective, three key insights stand out:

* Loan defaults are highly concentrated among borrowers with high DTI ratios and low credit scores.
* Certain loan purposes (debt consolidation and small business loans) show higher default risk compared to others.
* Stable income and longer employment tenure significantly improve repayment performance.
* These insights can help the bank improve credit screening, pricing strategies, and portfolio risk controls.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
